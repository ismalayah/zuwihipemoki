Her better partner Mitchell became the sole director of her firm Sauce E Limited the year following her death, according to the formal documents. Mitchell was a 25% owner in the company prior to her death. Until 2019, the company’s accounts showed a working capital of £1 million, including £920,000 in cash. Windsor’s fortune was allegedly amassed while working on the long-running TV series EastEnders. Between 1994 through 2016, she played the role of Peggy Mitchell on the program. Windsor was reputedly in debt to the tune of £1 million prior to her success on the famed television show. However, at the time of her death, the actress’s net worth was reported to be approximately £10 million.</p><h2>Barbara Windsor’s Death Resulted in a Deluge of Tributes</h2><p>Six years before her death, Windsor was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. Her devoted hubby cared for her over those years, until she was ultimately placed in a London care facility in the summer of 2020.&nbsp;Mitchell issued a statement after her death, stating, “It is with extreme regret that I can report that my lovely wife Barbara [Windsor] died at 8:35 p.m. on Thursday, December 10, at a London care facility.”&nbsp;The spouse said that he spent a week at her side before she died gently as a result of her sickness.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Scott-Mitchell-1.jpg alt="Scott Mitchell " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>When the news of Windsor’s death became public, condolences from all over the globe began to pour in on different social media sites.
