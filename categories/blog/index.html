Trembling, dirty and bloody—and packing a pistol, for some reason—he struggles to find a way out. The film's sound design is especially effective at the beginning, amplifying the crunching, squishing and sloshing with each step he takes. Overhead shots illuminated by lightning strikes reveal the carnage that surrounds him. Once he escapes, he stumbles into a nearby mansion in the woods where five frightened strangers similarly are suffering from memory loss.</p><footer><a href=../../open-grave-2014.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../the-seven-five-2015.html>The Seven Five movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2015)</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>

In one sense, Dowd, though suspected by some of his colleagues, was able to take his criminal career to such lengths because of cops’ unwillingness to rat on each other. (He eventually got popped by Suffolk County police for selling drugs there, not by the NYPD’s Internal Affairs unit.) On the other hand, the film clearly suggests the relative rarity of bad cops like Dowd in showing how difficult it was for him to get others to join him in his pursuit of easy money on the wrong side of the law.</p><footer><a href=../../the-seven-five-2015.html>Read more<i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-fw"></i></a></footer></article><article><header><h2><a href=../../dinosaur-2000.html>Dinosaur movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2000)</a></h2><div class=post-meta><div><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw"></i>
