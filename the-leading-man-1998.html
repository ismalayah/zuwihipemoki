<time>10 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The playwright, Felix Webb (<a href=#>Lambert Wilson</a>) is one of those men for whom romantic intrigue is hardly worth the trouble: His wife is bitter at his treatment of his family; his mistress is tired of his promises that someday, very soon, he will leave his wife. He can't be happy anywhere.</p><p>Felix's problems come to a boil during rehearsals for his new play, which stars both Robin and Hilary (<a href=#>Thandie Newton</a>), his mistress. It also stars two dependable British veterans, played by <a href=#>David Warner</a> and <a href=#>Patricia Hodge</a>, who have seen backstage affairs before, and will see them again, and simply turn up to do their jobs. (While the younger actors are doing nervous deep-breathing exercises before the curtain goes up, Warner's character listens to cricket and plays solitaire).</p><p>The playwright could be leading a very happy life. He has a big old house on the bank of the Thames, down from Hammersmith bridge, where his happy children play in the garden while his wife Elena (<a href=#>Anna Galiena</a>) steeps in resentment (one night as he sleeps, she takes a scissors and chops off his famous forelock). Elena is younger than Felix, and Hilary is younger still, living with roommates who race out to dance clubs and are amused by the fogey she has taken into her bed. But here's a twist: The young girl is steadfast and sincere in her love for him, and not portrayed as a flirt or a siren.</p><p>Robin, the American, quickly sees what Felix thinks is a secret, his affair with his leading lady. Robin makes the great man an offer: He will seduce Elena, clearing the field. "It would be doing a favor for a friend," he explains. "Besides, I've seen her photographs. She's a beautiful woman." So she is, and a faithful one, up to a point. But Robin studies his quarry carefully, making lists of the books she reads and the music she listens to (these details are not very convincing), and discovering her own secret--Elena is also a playwright, but her writing is hidden in the shadow of Felix's great reputation. He can help her but is something sinister concealed in Robin's helpfulness? He also is growing closer to his co-star, Hilary. Does he plan to take both women away from the playwright? And what about the gun he likes to play with? The film, directed by <a href=#>John Duigan</a> and written by his sister Virginia, is completely familiar with its show-biz world. Virginia is married to the director <a href=#>Bruce Beresford</a>, and Duigan himself has been long romantically linked with Newton, who he directed in the wonderful film "<a href=#>Flirting</a>" (1992). Little biographical details--like Newton's degree from Oxford--are lifted from life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46tn55lnJqupbXNoGSmmZ5ifnqFlw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-leading-man-1998.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zoe-boyle-frontier-wiki-bio-body-measurements-net-worth-husband.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zoe-boyle-frontier-wiki-bio-body-measurements-net-worth-husband.html>Zoe Boyle (Frontier) Wiki Bio, body measurements, net worth, husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./justin-ervins-net-worth-fact-career-awards-biography-life-story.html>Justin Ervins net worth, fact, career, awards, biography &amp;amp; life story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./justin-ervins-net-worth-fact-career-awards-biography-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
